# ⚡️ Quick start

Get started with OpenTrader in just a few steps. Follow this quick guide to install, configure, and run your crypto trading bot.

> [!NOTE]
> OpenTrader requires Node.js v22 or higher. You can check your Node.js version by running `node -v`

## Installation

1. Install OpenTrader globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g opentrader
```

2. Set an admin password for later accessing the OpenTrader UI:

```bash
opentrader set-password <password>
```

3. Start the OpenTrader app

```bash
opentrader up
```

The app will start the RPC server and listen on port 8000.

> **Tip**: Use `opentrader up -d` to start the app as a daemon. To stop it, run `opentrader down`.

# Usage

## UI

The user interface allows managing multiple bots and strategies, viewing backtest results, and monitoring live trading.

![UI Preview](.github/images/ui.png)

You can access the OpenTrader UI on: http://localhost:8000

## CLI

### Connect an exchange

Copy the `exchanges.sample.json5` file to `exchanges.json5` and add your API keys.

> Available exchanges: OKX, BYBIT, BINANCE, KRAKEN, COINBASE, GATEIO, BITGET

### Choose a strategy

Create the strategy configuration file `config.json5`. We will use the `grid` strategy as an example.

```json5
{
  // Grid strategy params
  settings: {
    highPrice: 70000, // upper price of the grid
    lowPrice: 60000, // lower price of the grid
    gridLevels: 20, // number of grid levels
    quantityPerGrid: 0.0001, // quantity in base currency per each grid
  },
  pair: "BTC/USDT",
  exchange: "DEFAULT",
}
```

> Currently supported strategies: `grid`, `dca`, `rsi`

### Run a backtest

Command: `opentrader backtest <strategy> --from <date> --to <date> -t <timeframe>`

Example running a `grid` strategy on `1h` timeframe.

```bash
opentrader backtest grid --from 2024-03-01 --to 2024-06-01 -t 1h
```

> To get more accurate results, use a smaller timeframe, e.g. 1m, however, it will take more time to download OHLC data from the exchange.

### Running a Live Trading

Command: `opentrader trade <strategy>`

Example running a live trading with `grid` strategy.

```bash
opentrader trade grid
```

> To stop the live trading, run `opentrader stop`
